        Virginia and the Central Appalachian region. These collections contain
        the business records and family papers of early settlers; the letters
        and diaries of the men, women, soldiers, and politicians, who founded a
        state in the midst of the Civil War; the papers of early industrial and
        labor leaders who shaped the stateâ€™s economic and political systems;
        county court records that document social history and genealogy;
        congressional and political papers documenting the history of state and
         national public policy; the research papers of West Virginia folklorists;
         and the manuscripts of prominent Appalachian authors.
